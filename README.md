# Multi-Cloud Migration & AI-Powered Cloud Automation

## Overview
This repository showcases the implementation of two advanced cloud-computing projects:

1. **Multi-Cloud Migration & CI/CD**
   - Migrating an on-premises eCommerce app to **AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure** for improved scalability and reliability.
   - Implementing **CI/CD pipelines** to automate deployment using **Terraform, AWS CodePipeline, and CodeBuild**.
   - Orchestrating microservices on **Kubernetes (EKS) & EC2** with real-time data synchronization using **DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Google BigQuery**.

2. **AI-Powered Cloud Automation**
   - Enhancing product recommendations by **40%** using **Claude 3 Sonnet (Amazon Bedrock) and Generative AI**.
   - Automating **80% of customer interactions** (order cancellations, inquiries) with **OpenAI GPT-4o**.
   - Using **Azure AI Text Analytics** to analyze customer reviews for sentiment insights and decision-making.
